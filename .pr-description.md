## Security Hardening & Release Automation

This PR introduces security improvements and sets up automated versioning and publishing workflows.

### Security Enhancements

- **Payload Guard**: Added configurable size limits (default 64 KiB) to prevent oversized log records from reaching storage or transport

### Release Automation

- **GitHub Actions Workflows**:
  - CI workflow: Lints, tests, and builds on every PR
  - Changeset validator: Ensures PRs include versioning information
  - Release workflow: Automatically creates version PRs and publishes to npm
